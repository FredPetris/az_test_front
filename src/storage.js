// Note: The reducer does nothing special! It just listens for the LOAD
//       action and merge in the provided state :)
// Note: A custom merger function can be passed as second argument

// Now it's time to decide which storage engine should be used
//
// Note: The arguments to `createEngine` are different for every engine!

// And with the engine we can create our middleware function. The middleware
// is responsible for calling `engine.save` with the current state afer

// Note: You can provide a list of action types as second argument, those
//       actions will be filtered and WON'T trigger calls to `engine.save`!

// a save operation.
//
// BUT (!) an existing old state HAS NOT been restored yet! It's up to you to
// decide when this should happen. Most of the times you can/should do this
// right after the store object has been created.

// To load the previous state we create a loader function with our prepared
// engine. The result is a function that can be used on any store object you
// have at hand :)
